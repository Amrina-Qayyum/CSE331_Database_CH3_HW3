# HW 3 — Chapter 3: Joins (CSCI 331 Database Systems)

**Student:** Amrina-Qayyum  
**Submission Date:** 2026-02-16  
**Database:** Northwinds2024Student

## Overview
This repository contains my HW3 work for **Chapter 3: Joins** using the **Northwinds2024Student** database.  
I reviewed join techniques from two Medium articles, ran Chapter 3 join examples, created real-life problem propositions, and implemented SQL join queries to solve them. The full walkthrough (queries + results) is shown in the MP4 video, and the written summary is in the PDF.:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Medium Articles Used
1) **LEFT JOIN twice (fixing a bad query)**  
   https://medium.com/@life-is-short-so-enjoy-it/sql-what-is-look-like-when-left-join-twice-fixing-a-bad-query-834b8f696b0e  
   Techniques: LEFT JOIN twice with aliases, avoid OR in join conditions, COALESCE usage.:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

2) **How To Write A Left Anti Join and Why**  
   https://sqlinsix.medium.com/hive-sql-and-t-sql-how-to-write-a-left-anti-join-and-why-74876e465f04  
   Techniques: LEFT ANTI JOIN pattern = LEFT JOIN + WHERE right side key IS NULL.:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## What’s Included
### Chapter 3 Examples (Executed)
I executed multiple join types in Northwinds2024Student (CROSS JOIN, INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, multi-table joins, and anti-joins) and captured outputs. All executions and results are shown in the MP4 video.:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

### Propositions + Queries (Executed)
I created real-life problem propositions based on the two Medium articles, wrote SQL join queries in Northwinds2024Student, executed them, and verified the results. Full SQL work is included in the `.sql` file and demonstrated in the MP4 video.:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

### To-do List + Gantt Evidence
Evidence of planning and tracking work using the To-do list and Gantt chart is included (see the PDF figure) and also shown in the MP4 walkthrough.:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
